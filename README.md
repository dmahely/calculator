# Calculator

My first React app! A simple calculator that uses the Math.js library because I can't be bothered to do the actual calculations myself. This project is part of my efforts to earn freeCodeCamp's _Front End Libraries Certification_ and therefore follows the user stories outlined [here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator). 


The webpage can be found in [my GitHub](https://dmahely.github.io/calculator/) and [my CodePen](https://codepen.io/dmahely/full/GaEvWV).
